                Almost on its own, Tesla has proven that electric vehicles can be desirable, combining outstanding performance and high-tech interiors with usable driving range.
                 The Model X crossover has room for up to seven. It’s also the most expensive <strong>, featuring the unique Falcon Wing doors. </strong> have your pick of two sedans: the 
                 lasive Model S is a hot rod. The smaller, less pricey Model 3 Performance isn’t far behind. The company has also revealed its wildly styled pickup truck, 
                 the Cybertruck. </p></div>

            <div class="col-6"><h2>About Tesla Model S and Model X </h2><p>The refreshed Tesla Model S and Model X are now both launched in the U.S., but the wait times for the Long Range versions of the car appears to be the longest in the entire lineup.

                Tesla has just updated the estimated delivery times (for new orders) and the entry-level versions (with base wheels) are new expected in March 2023.
                
                Even the addition of expensive wheels ($4,500 in the case of Model S and $5,500 in the case of Model X), shortens the queue to 12 months - as the estimated delivery date is November 2022.
                
                Only the Plaid versions are available faster - Model X Plaid (launched significantly later than the Model S) is expected in August 2022, while the Model S Plaid can be delivered within just one month - December 2021.</p></div>
